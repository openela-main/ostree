Subject: [PATCH 17/17] Add an always-on `inode64` feature

As I (and others) will be backporting the fix in
https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/2874/commits/de6fddc6adee09a93901243dc7074090828a1912
pretty far, I want a way for sysadmins and OS builders to
be able to reliably see when their version of ostree has this fix
(Because comparing version numbers isn't portable).
